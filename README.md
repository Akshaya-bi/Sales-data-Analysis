Sales Data Analysis Summary
Sales Performance:

Total Sales: 4280 units of products were sold in total.
High Sales Month: September stands out as the month with the highest sales volume (1630 units).

Sales by Channel and Payment Method:

Sales Channel Breakdown: While the data categorizes sales into wholesalers, direct sales, and online channels,.
Payment Method Performance: Interestingly, the data offers combined sales quantities for cash (2053 units) and online (2227 units) payment methods. This reveals that online sales might be a significant contributor, potentially exceeding cash sales in terms of unit volume.

Sales by Category and Month (Year-over-Year Comparison):

Category-wise Trends: The data provides a detailed breakdown of sales quantity by product category (Category01 to Category05) for each month across two years. This allows for examining sales trends for each category throughout the year.
Year-on-Year Comparison: More importantly, the data includes both the current year (CY) and previous year (PY) sales quantities for each category and month. This enables year-over-year comparisons to identify growth or decline in sales for each category.

Example: Sales Performance for Category 01 in November:

Current Year (CY): 195 units sold
Previous Year (PY): 1003 units sold

This example shows a potential decrease in sales for Category 01 in November compared to the previous year. Similar comparisons can be made for all categories and months to understand category-specific sales trends.



Additional Insights (Potential):

Identify best-selling categories: By analyzing sales data across all months, you can identify the top-selling categories (e.g., Category 03 might consistently have high sales throughout the year).
Channel preference by category: (e.g., online sales might be the preferred channel for Category 04).
Payment method preference by channel: (e.g., cash might be more common for wholesale transactions).

Overall:
This detailed sales data analysis provides valuable insights into the company’s sales trends across various product categories, channels, and payment methods. It allows for year-on-year comparisons to identify sales growth or decline for each category.
